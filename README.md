## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. 📞 Real-World Customer Care Call Analysis (Multi-Branch(10) Carwash Business)
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook  
**Description:** Led an end-to-end analysis of real customer service call records collected over multiple months from a premium carwash chain. Personally documented the calls, engineered features such as call periods, days, and hours, and visualized trends in reasons and responses, uncovering outlet-level operational insights. Presented findings in a professional Jupyter Notebook.  
**Business Value:** Enabled data-driven improvements in customer care processes, identified service gaps per branch, and supported strategic decision-making with actionable insights. A dashboard is in development to further enhance operations monitoring.  
**🔒 Data Protection:** Customer phone numbers were anonymized using alias mapping techniques, ensuring strict privacy and professional handling of sensitive information throughout the project.

### 2. 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction   
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, SMOTE  
**Description:** Developed and evaluated multiple classification models to predict customer churn using historical telecom data. Explored the impact of regularization, applied SMOTE to address class imbalance, and assessed models with ROC curves, confusion matrices, and precision-recall metrics.  
**Business Value:** Helps telecom providers reduce churn by identifying at-risk customers early and supporting the design of personalized retention campaigns.

## Projects I have collaborated on:

### **Safaricom & Airtel App Sentiment Analysis**

Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy, TF-IDF, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit, FastAPI
Description: Designed and implemented an NLP-powered sentiment analysis system on over 5,000 real 2025 app reviews from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store for Kenya’s top telecom apps — M-PESA, MySafaricom, Airtel Money, and MyAirtel. Conducted extensive text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal), applied TF-IDF for feature extraction, and trained multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, and BERT. The best-performing model (Logistic Regression with SMOTE) was deployed via FastAPI and Streamlit for real-time sentiment prediction.
Business Value: Enables telecom companies to monitor customer sentiment in real time, detect early warning signs from negative reviews, and enhance user experience based on data-driven insights. Revealed key issues such as app crashes, login errors, bundle pricing complaints, and low company response rates to negative reviews — offering clear opportunities for customer experience improvement and brand trust building.
