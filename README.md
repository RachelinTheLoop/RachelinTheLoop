## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. 📞 Real-World Customer Care Call Analysis (Multi-Branch Carwash Business, Kenya)
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Jupyter Notebook  
**Description:** Led an end-to-end analysis of real customer service call records collected over multiple months from a premium carwash chain. Personally documented the calls, engineered features such as call periods, days, and hours, and visualized trends in reasons and responses, uncovering outlet-level operational insights. Presented findings in a professional Jupyter Notebook.  
**Business Value:** Enabled data-driven improvements in customer care processes, identified service gaps per branch, and supported strategic decision-making with actionable insights. A dashboard is in development to further enhance operations monitoring.  
**🔒 Data Protection:** Customer phone numbers were anonymized using alias mapping techniques, ensuring strict privacy and professional handling of sensitive information throughout the project.
